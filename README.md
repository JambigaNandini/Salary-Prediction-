##Salary Prediction
This is a beginner-level machine learning project where I built a simple regression model to predict salaries based on experience and other features. As a fresher, this project helped me practice core Python skills, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
##About Me
I'm Jambiga Nandini, a Computer Science student specializing in AI & ML. I'm passionate about building mini projects to strengthen my skills and prepare for internships and entry-level roles in data science and machine learning.
##Project Overview
- Goal: Predict salary based on input features like years of experience
- Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- Model: Linear Regression
- Evaluation: R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
##Files Included
- `Salary_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset used for training
- `Salary_dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs
##What I Learned
- How to clean and explore a dataset
- How to build and train a regression model
- How to evaluate model performance
- How to document and share a project on GitHub
##How to Run This Project (Google Colab – Manual Upload)
1. Go to Google Colab
2. Click **File → Upload Notebook** and select `Salary_dataset.ipynb` from your computer
3. In the notebook, use the upload button to upload `Salary_dataset.csv`
4. Run all cells to see the predictions and model evaluation
